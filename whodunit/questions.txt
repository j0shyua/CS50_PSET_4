Whodunit questions

1) stdint.h is a header file that allows programmers to use specific sizes for integers

2) By using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, uint16_t, the programmer knows the exact size of an integer variable or constant 
is, which can allow a program to work properly on any computer, and make up certain file types.

3)  BYTE = 1 byte
    DWORD = 4 bytes
    LONG = 4 bytes
    WORD = 2 bytes
   
4) First two letters of BMP file are "BM," or 66 77 in ASCII, or 0x42 0x4d in hexadecimal

5) biSize is the number of bytes required by the structure BITMAPINFOHEADER, while bfSize is the size in bytes of the bitmap file.

6) If biHeight is negative, the order of the pixels in the BMP are from top to bottom.

7) biBitCount specifies the BMP's color depth/bits per pixel.

8) fopen could possibly return NULL in lines 24 and 2 because the program does not have sufficient permissions to 
read or write a file, or the file does not exist.

9) The third argument in fread is 1, because the size of the block is the size defined in the header.

10) padding = 3

11) fseek changes the pointer in a file so that you can read a certain area of a file.

12) SEEK_CUR is the current location of the pointer in a file, which can be changed by using fseek.
